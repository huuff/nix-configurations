* I couldn't for the life of me write a consistent passwordless way to login users in tests. If I set the `password` property in Nix to empty, then I can't do it with `passwd` from the testing library. If I remove it with `passwd -d` in the testing library, I can't do it in Nix. I could set it to empty with Nix and then remove it from `/etc/shadow` in the testing library but it feels like too much effort... For now, I just set it to `password`
* I'm migrating modules from the `services` namespace to `machines`. If I override a module in NixOS (using `disabledModules`) a lot of problems ensue. So I prefer not to collide with these and put mine under `machines`. I guess I'll keep a few on `services`, only those that are independent from specific machines instantiations
