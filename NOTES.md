* I've found nowhere I'd like to set `mkDefault` for my machines. This is in part because I've never had to make several of them work together and I've not seen what problems I could find. Besides, I also realized that most of them are just `systemd` cruft that would be removed if I make my module to order executions. Maybe I could `mkDefault` the `phpfpm` configuration? Or maybe better just a module for it.
