# TODO
* Maybe Zammad? osTicket seems dated

## Neuron
* Add SSL options

## osTicket
* Still can't enter localhost:8989/scp (Or more explicitly: it doesn't redirect me to scp/admin.php)
* Add backup options
* Add email options
* Why is multi-user target reached before having run my systemd units? but only on some computers? a complete mystery
* Currently, I have a hack for `setup-users` to launch only on first boot. Manage to get ConditionFirstBoot to work in order to remove it.

## Mail/SNM
* Give it some love
