## Neuron
* Use a systemd user oneshot script to initialize directory (check home-manager/nixos). Or maybe not? I'm not sure oneshot is for this
* Make user configurable. Or not? I don't really care

## osTicket
* The initial script only seems to get executed if inlined
* I can't access the database using mysql -uosticket
