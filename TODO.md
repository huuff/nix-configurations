# TODO
* osTicket forces users to install through a GUI, so it's not very suitable for Nix. Maybe use zammad

## Neuron
* Add SSL options

## osTicket
* APCu extension? supposedly that makes it faster
* Does changing ost-config.php to put database info help in any way?
* Add SSL options
* Add backup options
* Can't enter admin panel! (/scp). It redirects to https so maybe I must set a certificate? Update: Welp, I actually can (http://localhost:8989/scp/login.php). But why does it redirect me to https?
